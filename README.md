This is just some javascript array excersizes (from javascript30.com). I did this mainly to help myself
brush up on methods and get help with a kick start to functional javascript. I will modify many of these to show various ways of accomplishing the same outcome with different code.

This will also showcase some push, pop, and other array features.
