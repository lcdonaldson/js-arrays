This repo is just some javascript array excersizes (mainly from a wes bos tutorial). I did this mostly to help myself
brush up on methods and get help with a kick start to functional javascript. I will modify many of these to show various ways of accomplishing the same outcome with different code.

This will also showcase other coding challenges and various real life array scenarios I find in doing freelance jobs.
